# Counting islands. Classical Algorithms

You have a matrix MxN that represents a map. There are 2 possible states on the map:
1 - islands, 0 - the ocean. Your task is to calculate the number of islands in the most
effective way.

### Implemented algorithm: 

Breadth First Traversal (BFS) with 4 direction vectors (used for traversing the adjacent cells)

### Files:

island_finder.py - python script containing the needed functions

test_island_finder.py - pytest script with 3 test cases
