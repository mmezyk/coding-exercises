# MNIST classifier. OOP.

You have 3 different models to solve MNIST (handwritten digits database) classification
problem:
- Convolutional Neural Network (any architecture, any framework); input: tensor 28x28x1;
- Random Forest classifier; input: 1-d numpy array of length 784 (28x28 pixels);
- Model that provides random value (for simplicity) as a result of classification; input: 10x10 numpy array, the center crop of the image.

The goal is to build a DigitClassifier model that takes an algorithm as an input
parameter. Possible values for the algorithm are: cnn, rf, rand for the three models
described above.

There is NO need to implement a training function inside DigitClassifier and focus on
the quality of the model, just raise a Not implemented exception. We need to focus only
on the predict function that takes a 28x28x1 image as input and provides a single
integer value as output.

Ideally, the solution should contain:
- Interface for models like Convolutional Neural Network, Random Forest classifier,
Random model. Potentially other developers will develop new models, so we
need to have an interface for them. Letâ€™s call it DigitClassificationInterface. 
- 3 classes (1 for each model) that implement DigitClassificationInterface. 
- DigitClassifier, which takes as an input parameter the name of the algorithm
and provides predictions with exactly the same structure (inputs and outputs) not
depending on the selected algorithm.
